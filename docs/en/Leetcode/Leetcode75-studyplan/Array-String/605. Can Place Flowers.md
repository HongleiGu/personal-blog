**You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.**

**Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.**
 
- Example 1:

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```
Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

- 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
- flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
- 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

three cases:

- at the beginning [0,0,1] -> [1,0,1]
- at the end [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1]
- in the middle: [0,0,0] -> [0,1,0] (three consecutive zeros)

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        # in order to place a flower, we need to find at least three consecutive 0
        zeros = 1 # in case of [0,0,1] -> [1,0,1]
        for i in flowerbed:
            if i == 0: # if zero, we count 1
                zeros += 1
                if zeros >= 3: # if at least three consecutive zeros, we can plant a flower
                    n -= 1 # [0,0,0] -> [0,1,0]
                    if n == 0:
                        return True # early stopping
                    zeros = 1
            else:
                zeros = 0 # end of consective flower
        if zeros >= 2: # in case of [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1]
            n -= 1
        return n <= 0
