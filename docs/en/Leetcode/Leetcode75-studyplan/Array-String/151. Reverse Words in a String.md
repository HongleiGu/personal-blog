**Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.**

**A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.**

**Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.**

**Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.**

- Example 1:

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

- Example 3:

```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.
 
**Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?**

three solutions: first is reverse each word then do a huge reverse

## solution1:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = s.strip()
        s = list(s)
        right = 0
        left = 0
        while (right < len(s)):
            while (left < len(s) and s[left] != " "):
                left += 1
            self.reverseWord(s,right, left-1)
            left += 1
            right = left
            while (right < len(s) and s[right] == " "):
                del s[right]
        self.reverseWord(s,0,len(s)-1)
        return "".join(s)
    
    def reverseWord(self, s: str, left: int, right: int) -> None:
        while (left <= right):
            self.swap(s,left,right)
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        
        
    def swap(self, s: str, left: int, right: int) -> None:
        temp = s[left]
        s[left] = s[right]
        s[right] = temp
```

## solution2:

extract the words, do a reverse on the list

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = s.strip()
        w = []
        r = 0
        l = 0
        n = len(s)
        while (r < n):
            while (l < n and s[l] != " "):
                l += 1
            w.append(s[r:l])
            l += 1
            r = l
            while (r < n and s[r] == " "):
                r += 1
            l = r
        r = len(w) - 1
        l = 0
        while (l <= r):
            t = w[r]
            w[r] = w[l]
            w[l] = t
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return " ".join(w)
```

## solution3:

use built-in solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        return " ".join(reversed(s.split()))
```
