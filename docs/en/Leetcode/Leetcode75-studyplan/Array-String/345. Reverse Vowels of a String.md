**Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.**

**The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.**

- Example 1:

```
Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".
```

- Example 2:

```
Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"
```
 

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
- s consist of printable ASCII characters.


It is notable, that, list iteration is slightly slower than string iteration since strings are immuatable, but lists are mutable

also, empirialism provides that shorter variable name are usually time-efficient, consider refactoring

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        i = 0
        j = len(s) - 1
        t = list(s)
        while i < j:
            while i < j and t[i] not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
                i += 1
            while j > i and t[j] not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
                j -= 1
            x = t[i]
            t[i] = t[j]
            t[j] = x
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        return "".join(t)
```

- space complexity: O(1)
