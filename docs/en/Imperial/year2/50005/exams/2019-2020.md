## a:
- TCP
- LAN
- DDos
- RTT
## b.
### (i)
ipconfig <span style="color:red">ifconfig -a, ipconfig is for windows</span>

## (ii)
dig example.com <span style="color:red">dig MX example.com</span>

## (iii)
traceroute shell.example.com

### (iv)
ssh shell.example.com

## c.
- 802.11 is used when connecting to wireless access point
- DHCP is assign to us by the router after connecting to the access point
- ARP is used to resolve the correct MAC address before sending
- IP and TCP are used to send packets to us
- DNS is used to resolve the IP address, and DNS uses UDP be default
- SMTP is used when the email sender send the email to the server
- IMAP is used when we view the email
- POP3 is used when we download the email

## d.
UDP, in video transmission, we need to make sure the frames in every second is transferred appropriately, which usually means 30 or 60 frame second with delay as short as possible, therefore in this case we favour UDP over TCP

<span style="color:red">The question is not about video playing be filtering based on the keywords, we dont care about the speed, TCP</span>
## e.
### (a)
social engineering

## (b)
- recruit some better guards
- add authentication to the server so even if the hacker has the phone number, he/she is unable to break into the server
- add some authentication to the building, making sure irrelevant people dont have access to internal items or staff

## a.
we know that
- a = 4
- b = 5
- g = 6
- p = 41
the public value can be calculated by $x = (g^a\mod p) = 25$, $y = (g^b \mod p) = 27$ and the shared secret key $g^{ab}\mod p = 6^20\mod 41 = 18$

so following the Caeser Cipher, we shift the letter of pass by 18 letters, which gives dogg

## b.
## (i)

The range of Interface 1 is 192.173.0.0 - 192.173.255.255

The range of Interface 2 is 192.168.0.0 - 192.171.255.255

so 192.172.0.0 - 192.172.255.255 is missed

## (ii)

0.0.0.0/0

## c.
### (a)
#### (i)
25 A class host and 25 B class host gives 150 NICs

<span style="color">200 since each host require 4</span>

#### (ii)
each host require 2 NIC, 100 NICs in total

#### (iii)
each host require 2 NIC, except the ends require 1 NIC each, 98 NICs in total

#### (iv)
each host require 1 NIC, 50 in totall

### (b)
to connect all the networks, we need ceil(50/8) = 7 switches to connect all the hosts, and we need one extra 

<span style="color:red">each switch can only connect 7 hosts, the one remaining needs to connect to another switch, so 8</span>





## d.
### (i)
following $c = f\lambda$, $f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3*10^8m/s}{22.44cm} =\frac{3*10^8m/s}{0.2244m} = 1.3369*10^9s^{-1} = 1.3369*10^9Hz = 1.3369*10^3MHz = 1336.9MHz$

### (ii)
- d = t1-t0 = 17h8m58s <span style="color:red">=61738s</span>
- R = 56Kbps
- t2 - t1<span style="color:red">(t2-t0)</span> = 61738.3714 s

so $L = (t2-t1) R = 61738.3714s * 56*10^3bit/s = 3457346798.4bit = 432168599.8Byte$

 $\color{red}L = (t2-t1) R = (61738.3714s = 61738s) * 7KB/s = 2.5998KB = 2599.8Byte$

and one character takes one byte
