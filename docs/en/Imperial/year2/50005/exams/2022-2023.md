.assume 0 packet loss, 0 process and queueing delay 0 overhead from headers and footers

RTT = 2dprop

$dprop = L/R = 65535B/(1Gbps*0.26) = 524380B/2.6*10^8bps = 2.016ms$

DHCP works in the way that a newly booted machine broadcasts DHCP DISCOVER packet when it connects, and DHCP replies with the assign IP address according to the MAC send to the DHCP server, tricking DHCP with a false MAC will let it assume this is another device or address

$\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3*10^8m/s}{60000Hz} = 5000m = 5km$

assume they are still functioning and the AI swarm is a bunch of hardware running with unlicensed cable, then the can be interfered electromagnetically, maybe it could paralyse the AI

so IPv4 has 32bits, the CIDR restricts the first 16 bits to be identical, so 2^16

TDM is a strategy to avoid transmission conflicts

Stations wait for turn to transmit and the transmission rate is limited to R/N, where R is the maximum channel rate and N is the stations sharing channels

A slotted ALOHA means the time is split into multiple slots and stations should only transmit on the beginning of a slot, if conflict then wait for a slot of retransmit immediately

assume this day we have the same number of patient we had on average, then 400/16 = 25 patients/hour = 5/12 patients/minute
