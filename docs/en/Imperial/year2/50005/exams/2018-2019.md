dprop = 

## c:
the DNS resolves the IP of the website and the website get the IP and MAC from you using DHCP, then the website gets the resource from the CDN website, 

## d:
The access control list has not added them into the corresponding place, alter the  Firewall block the ip address or port number

for example, they might use clickjacking to let unintended users accidentally view the file in a hidden ad

### ii:
they are use IP or MAC spoofing to pretend to be someone else

## b:
MTU = 1500B, the max UDP datagrams is 65536 Bytes and the IP header is 20B, below the MTU, we can fragment the datagrams in 1024B each, so we have 64 segments

## c:
### i
2048 = 2^11, so we need to use 11 bits and the first 21 fixed, the subnet mask is 255.255.7.0 or some ip/24

### ii:
we can either connect 47 devices with 4800$ or 63 devices with 6400$, so obviously 6400 $\$$ is cheaper on average

2048 / 63 = 32 ... 32, so we purchase another 48 port switch

32 * 6400 + 4800 = 204800 + 4800 = 209600

the Application Layer services like google mail, the data link layer to install the cables and the Physical layer the cable itself
