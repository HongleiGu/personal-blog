## a:
### i
192.168.1.1:80 <span style="color:red">http uses 80 port</span>

## ii
NAT(Network Address Translation)

### iii
can be any within 1024 - 65536

### iv
the firewall

## b:
Packetization: $L/R = 1GB/2Mbps = 8*10^3 Mb/2Mbps = 4000s$

propagation delay = total time - Packetization time = $69min42s - 4000s = 4182 - 4000 = 182s$

so the $s = vt = vc = 182s 3*10^8m/s = 182*3*10^5km/s = 546*10^5 km$

## c:
first, assume the OHAI works the same as ELHO, then it may be sending a request to example.edu to see if we were able to connect to it

$\#$ MKAY seems to represent the response gotten from the website, so the second line means the example.edu gets the request and the connection is established

then we tell the website we are going to use port 12345, and the website sets the port

GIEF seems to be wanting a file at this path, so the website connects to port 12345, send the file and an empty line

KTHXBAI is most likely telling the website the conversation ended

so finally the website responded with DISCONNECTING to signal the end

## d
so first, the window size is set to MSS which is 1B, a char is 1B so the first segment contains A, then the MSS doubles, segment contains BC, ; it then doubles so DEFG changing to CA
## e.
so first, the enable webserver access we need HTTP and HTTPS to be working, so we open 80 and 443 for the destination, but for the source we need to open all possible ports since request can be send to any available port, so Allow, *

FTP need to use port 20 & 21 so Allow 20&21

opening 25 and 110 is most likely for SMTP and POP3, which are used wen viewing and downloading the email, and the source port should be any port

$* TCP, Enable email$

DNS uses port 53, so Allow, $*$, 53

DENY

# 2
## a
when A is down, other think A is alive, but any direct packet sending will not work, so B thinks the distance to D is B to C to D

## b:
so the first line tells us the using is downloading an email from SMTP, which originates from localhost:54322 and the connection is establish, then there are multiple emails from 54321 and 54320 to 25, the virus could be sending junk emails repeatedly to the user, disguised as the use itself

## c:
### 1
syn flooding?
### 2:
connecting the server to the router

### 3:
replacing the hub to a switch
