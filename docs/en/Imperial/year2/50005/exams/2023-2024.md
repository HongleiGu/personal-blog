### iii:

### iv:

## b:
L3 header is 20 B

13 bits mean the ip address can support 8192 fragments each fragment is 8B, so 0-65536 bytes in total, with the first 20 be the L3 header, so only 65516 Bytes

65536 65516

## c:
we can use any one less than the NIC card's speed limit or 1300Mpbs, so 1Gbps, 500Mbps, 125Mbps, bu the ideal speed would be 1Gbps as it is faster

<span style="color:red">the router sets a limit collectively so the 4 headsets together must not exceed 2Gbps, but the NIC, USB, etc. only set the limit on a single device, therefore the answer is 500Mbps, I think if you assume there are other devices 125Mbps can be reasonable if you want more stability</span>

### i
#### (i)

doors: $56 * 2 = 112$, hallways 56

#### (ii)
doors: $56 * 2 - 2 = 110$. hallways $55$

### ii
#### (a)
1 switch can at most connect to 7 computers and a additional switch, so 56 / 7 = 8 switches

#### (b)

there are 56 computers in total, round to the nearest 2^n gives 64 or 2^6, so the first 26 bits are the same, of CIDR /26, so the mask is assume all the devices are in IP 192.168.x.x then 192.168.0.0/26

<span style="color:red">subnet masks are in the form of 255.255.255.192, always fill as many 1 as possible</span>

## e
### i:
- line 2, ipv4 should never contain values over 255, should be 192,
- line 6, only 192.168.20.0/24 have FTP access, so should be 192.168.20.
- line 9, it denies 192.168.20.0's FTP access
- line 10, it denies 192.169.30.0's Mail access
