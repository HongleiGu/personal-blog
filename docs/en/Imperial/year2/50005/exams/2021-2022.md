UDP max segment 65507 B,

one view takes 37.5MB/65507B = 10^6*37.5/65507 = 572.4

so we need 573 packets, each have L3 and L4 headers of 28B in total so 16044B for a single view, then 

$16044 * 10.2*10^9 = 163.65 * 10^12$

so 163.65 TB

A: 100MB/3s = 0.1GB/3s  = 0.8Gb/3s = 0.233Gps, yes
B: dtrans = L/R = 0.05s = 50ms, dprop = 450ms, so actually $R = L/d = 4MB/450ms = 32Mb/0.45s = 71.1 ms$ yes
C: dprop = 130ms, so Rprop = L/d = 200MB/130ms = 1600Mb/0.13s = 12307.7 Mbps
dtrans = 800ms so Rtrans = L/dtrans = 200MB/800ms = 1600Mb/0.8s = 2000MB, no

## e
### i.
http uses 25 port, so the third line should be :25, 500 is not OK should be 200, the IP address changed from line 2 to 3, should not duplicate the url

## b
### i
the switch and the server

### ii
since TCP can take a long time and it needs to use SYN and FIN to validate packets, having only a single thread coulf mean waiting indefinitely

## d
### i
assume their password is directly visible, it can potentially expose you passwords if social engineer or someone take hacks your tool (assuming the passwords are not stored in hashed strings)
