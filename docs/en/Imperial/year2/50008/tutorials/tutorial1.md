# Key concepts:

Outcome, sample space, events

$\sigma$ and axioms of probability the three axioms

- Conditional probability
- Conditional independence
- Bayes theorem
- Law of total probability

# Problem valid $\sigma$-algebras

Consider the sample space $\textbf{S} = \{s_1, s_2, s_3\}$ and the following two classes of its subsets:

$$\begin{aligned}
\textbf{F}_1 &= \{\varnothing, \{s_1\}, \{s_2,s_3\}, S\}\\
\textbf{F}_2 &= \{\varnothing, \{s_2\}, \{s_1,s_3\}, S\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

- Are $\textbf{F}_1$ and $\textbf{F}_2$ valid $\sigma$-algebras?

yes
- Is $\textbf{F}_1\cap \textbf{F}_2$ valid $\sigma$-algebra

yes, the union is only $\{\varnothing, S\}$
- Is $\textbf{F}_1\cup \textbf{F}_2$ valid $\sigma$-algebra

no $\{s_1, s_2\}$ is not in the set





the requirements are nonempty, close under complements, closed under countable union
