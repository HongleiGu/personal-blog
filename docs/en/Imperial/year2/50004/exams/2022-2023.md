## a
- 1: the thread is created
- 2: the thread runs the task it is assigned to
- 3: the thread is assigned a new task to complete
- 4: the thread is waiting due to some synchronisation mechanism
- 5: the thread finish waiting and is able to execute the next task
- 6: the thread finish all the task and terminates
