## a
A monolithic kernel puts almost all core OS functionalities into one single executable with its own address space, it allows for efficient calls within kernel and it is easier to write kernel components due to shared memory, it enable more convenient communication among kernel components,  but it may also have more complex design with loads of interactions, there is also no protection between kernel components and it is vulnerable to crashes,

A microkernel, on the other hand only has a minimal kernel with functionalities in the user-level servers, therefore the different is the amount of kernel functionality, and the microkernel has IPC mechanisms to communicate between kernel components, the kernel itself is not complex as a monolithic kernel so it is less error-prone, servers can have clean interfaces and servers can reboot or even crash without bringing kernel down, but the overhead of IPC is high so the kernel is slow

## b
in monolithic kernels, it throws a page fault and crashes the kernel, but the microkernel can throw an error but allows the user to recheck their environment

## d
### (i)
Level 1, RAID level 1 mainly serves as a back storage place, so it is more suitable for the temporary storage, also, the data stores in one piece, and failure recovering is easy

### (ii)
Level 0, in a highly-available web server, we value read speed more than write speed, level 0 work best for a storage that often reads but seldom writes

### (iii)

Level 1, for database it must support concurrency, so Level 1 suits the most

## a
### (i)
Dave, Edward, Fred, Alice, Bob
### (ii)
She must request any of the D4 group to copy their rights to write to the GPU to her in order to write to the GPU

### (iii)
the attacker can
- read and write(D2) to File 1
- write to GPU

## (iv)
his account is compromised like (iii), or the access matrix is altered

## (v)
move or copy Henry to group 2

## b
Access control matrix: its generally more accessible as it is a global matrix stored in one piece, but also more expensive as matrices can be huge

Access control List: List are stored with each object, it can reduce duplications but it may be hard to find all the rights one person owns
